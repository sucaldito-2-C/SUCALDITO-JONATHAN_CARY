cat("I. Introduction\n\n")
cat("Daily allowance plays an important role in meeting the everyday needs of 
    college students, including transportation, meals, school supplies, and 
    other essential expenses. For students of Iloilo Science and Technology 
    University (ISAT-U), the adequacy of their daily allowance can greatly 
    influence their academic experience and overall well-being.\n\nThis study 
    aims to assess whether the daily allowance of ISAT-U college students is 
    sufficient to cover their daily needs. Using data gathered from a student 
    survey, this research analyzes students’ daily allowance, spending patterns, 
    and perceptions of financial sufficiency. The collected data are presented 
    through graphical representations to clearly illustrate trends and 
    differences among respondents.\n\n")

    balanced in terms of gender. Males slightly outnumber females, with 27 male 
    students (53%) compared to 24 female students (47%). This near-equal 
    distribution suggests that any analysis of daily allowance sufficiency will 
    fairly represent the perspectives of both genders. Additionally, the pie

    gender dominates the sample, which supports more equitable comparisons in
