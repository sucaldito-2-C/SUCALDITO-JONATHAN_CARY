##Exercise 1 Create a vector using : operator
a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output. Describe its output.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
y <- c(-5:5)
print(y)
```
output: it's out put is sequencial from -5 to 5
 [1] -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5
b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
x <- c(1:7)
print(x)
```
The value of x is:
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

##Exercise 2.* Create a vector using seq() function
a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```
