```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
a. Describe the data.
```{r}
household <- data.frame(
  ShoeSize = c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 
               10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 
               7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),
  Height = c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 64.0, 70.0, 73.0, 72.0, 64.0,
             74.5, 67.0, 71.0, 71.0, 77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 62.0, 72.0, 66.0, 
             64.0, 73.0, 69.0, 70.0, 69.0, 70.0),
  Gender = c("F", "F", "F", "F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "M", "F",
             "F", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M", "F", "F", "F", "F",
             "F", "M", "M", "M", "M", "M")
)

household

```

b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.
What its result? Show the R scripts.
```{r}
# Create data frame

# Subset by gender
male <- subset(household, Gender == "M", select = c(ShoeSize, Height))
female <- subset(household, Gender == "F", select = c(ShoeSize, Height))

# Display subsets
male
female
```

c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}
# Mean of all respondents
mean_shoesize <- mean(household$ShoeSize)
mean_height <- mean(household$Height)

mean_shoesize
mean_height

```

d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
Yes — there appears to be a positive relationship between shoe size and height.
From observation:

Taller people tend to have larger shoe sizes.

Males generally have both larger shoe sizes and greater height than females.


2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to
factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out
the factor levels below the actual values.
```{r}
months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
            "September","October","September","November","August",
            "January","November","November","February","May","August",
            "July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")

factor_months_vector <- factor(months)
print(factor_months_vector)

```

3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-
pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
```{r}
# Create the character vector
months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
            "September","October","September","November","August",
            "January","November","November","February","May","August",
            "July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")

# Convert to factor
factor_months_vector <- factor(months)

# Check summaries
summary(months)
summary(factor_months_vector)

```

4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
Note: Apply the factor function with required order of the level.
new_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_order_data)
```{r}
direction <- c(rep("East", 1), rep("West", 4), rep("North", 3))
factor_data <- factor(direction, levels = c("East", "West", "North"))
print(factor_data)
summary(factor_data)

```

5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv
a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function.
b. View the dataset. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r import_data}
library(readxl)
import_march <- read_excel("import_march.xlsx")
print(import_march)
```

6. Full Search
```{r}
num <- 15
numbers <- 1:50
found <- FALSE

for (i in numbers) {
  if (i == num) {
    found <- TRUE
    break
  }
}

if (!found) {
  cat("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50\n")
} else if (num == 20) {
  cat("TRUE\n")
} else {
  cat("You selected:", num, "\n")
}

```

7 a. Write a function that prints the minimum number of bills that must be paid, given the price of the snack.
Input: Price of snack (a random number divisible by 50) Output: Minimum number of bills needed to purchase a snack.
```{r}
minimum_bills <- function(price) {
 
  bills <- c(1000, 500, 200, 100, 50)
  
  remaining <- price
  count <- 0
  
  for (bill in bills) {
    if (remaining >= bill) {
      num <- remaining %/% bill  
      count <- count + num
      remaining <- remaining - num * bill
    }
  }
  
  cat("Minimum number of bills needed:", count, "\n")
}

price_of_snack <- 1350
minimum_bills(price_of_snack)

```

8. The following is each student’s math score for one semester. Based on this, answer the following questions.
a. Create a data frame from the above table. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}

grades <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)


grades

```

b. Without using the rowMean function, output the average score of students whose average
math score over 90 points during the semester. write R code and its output.
Example Output: Annie’s average grade this semester is 88.75.
```{r}
grades <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)

# Loop through each student to calculate average
for (i in 1:nrow(grades)) {
  total <- grades$Grade1[i] + grades$Grade2[i] + grades$Grade3[i] + grades$Grade4[i]
  avg <- total / 4
  if (avg >= 90) { 
    cat(grades$Name[i], "’s average grade this semester is", avg, "\n")
  }
}


```

c. Without using the mean function, output as follows for the tests in which the average
score was less than 80 out of 4 tests.
Example output: The nth test was difficult.
```{r}
grades <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)

for (i in 2:ncol(grades)) {
  total <- sum(grades[, i])
  avg <- total / nrow(grades)
  
  if (avg < 80) {
    cat("The", i - 1, "th test was difficult.\n")
  }
}

```

d. Without using the max function, output as follows for students whose highest score for
a semester exceeds 90 points.
Example Output: Annie’s highest grade this semester is 95.
```{r}
grades <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)

for (i in 1:nrow(grades)) {
  highest <- grades[i, 2] 
  for (j in 3:ncol(grades)) {
    if (grades[i, j] > highest) {
      highest <- grades[i, j]
    }
  }
  if (highest > 90) {
    cat(grades$Name[i], "’s highest grade this semester is", highest, "\n")
  }
}

```
